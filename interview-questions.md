# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is JSX? What is one syntax difference between HTML and JSX?

Your answer:
JSX Stands for javascript extensible markup. It can be seen as the joining of javascript and HTML. One syntax difference is that the HTML class attribute must be changed to className, as class is already reserved by Javascript. An important thing to note as well, if you are outputting HTML and wish to include ANY javascript functionality, it needs to be wrapped in curly braces ({}).
Researched answer: As webpage content became more and more dependant on user interaction, it became prudent to no longer seperate html and javascript into different domains. JSX (JavaScript XML (extensible markup language)) provided the solution. By expanding the JavaScript language to include HTML, it became possible to manage webpage content through javascript components, dynamically returning HTML based on javascript logic. Though JSX allows fairly free transition from Javascript and HTML, there are some syntactical changes. For one, the HTML class attribute uses a reserved name in javascript, so it is replaced with className.

1. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified when you run the command yarn in your terminal?

Your answer: yarn is a package manager (it stands for yet another resource negotiator) to manage the acquisition and updating of dependencies for various projects. Using the yarn command will create or update the package.json file and the yarn.lock file in your directory.

Researched answer: yarn is a package manager for code bases. It not only manages the acquisition of needed code, but also manages a seperate manifest which keeps track of what version of code was downloaded. Yarn allows for the distribution of code bases with version checking and tracking, to simplify development of code by keeping everyone on the same page in terms of their code libraries.

3. What is a React component?

Your answer: A react component is a self-contained, re-usable package of code for use in React applications. It allows for the breakdown of large webpages with many different sections into discrete blocks of code that can be used multiple times, can display data dynamically, and can be used to improve page performance by only updating when changes are needed, versus requiring an entire page reload.
